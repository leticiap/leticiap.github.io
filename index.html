					<p>Hello! My name is Leticia Pasdiora, I'm a programmer and game developer from Curitiba, Brazil, but I am currently living in Montreal. I am really passionate about developing games, and I hope someday to be working on the huge companies making AAA games. The desire of developing games came naturally as an avid player, but also, it really fascinates me the uniqueness from video games, as for me, they are the culmination of art, combining writing, drawing, music and mathematics. I feel complete developing games, and that is why I am pursuing this career.</p>
